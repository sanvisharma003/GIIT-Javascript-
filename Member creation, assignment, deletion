ASSIGNMENT
- we can target a member and then change it entirely. the old assignments would be deleted and the new would come into effect.
- an example
intially, the car object looked like this
var car = {
    make: "volvo",
    speed: 160,
    drive: function(){ return "drive"; }
};
we can change it and so the object would be lost and car would now become a string.
car="volvo"

-in order to target a single member of the car object, simply write 
car.make = "jaguar"

CREATION
- In order to create a new member in an object, you can simply write something like
car.model="ss80" and the new result will be 
{make: "Ford Chevy", speed: 4, engine: Object, model: "ss80", stop: function}

- if we just want to add a new property without defining it, then it will not be added.
car.color
{make: "Ford Chevy", speed: 4, engine: Object, model: "ss80", stop: function}
no changes in the object, and it remains same.

- only after assigning the value, changes will be made.
car.color='red'
{make: "Ford Chevy", speed: 4, engine: Object, model: "ss80", stop: function, color: "red"}

DELETION
- a property can be deleted by using the 'delete' keyword. 
delete car.color
