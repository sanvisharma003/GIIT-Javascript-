- when a new test is written, a new testing framework is needed. some of them include jasmine, mocha, chai etc.
- 'describe' is kind of a global test folder that may contain multiple test cases.
each test case is written in 'it' block

describe("First Demo", function(){
  it("Sample1", async ()=>
  {
    //webdriver io code for a single test case is wrapped here
  });

  it("Sample2", async ()=>
