MEMBER ACCESS
.(dot) is the member access operator

- an example
var car = {
    make: "volvo",
    speed: 160,
    engine: {
        size: 2.0,
        make: "bmw",
        fuel: "petrol",
        pistons:[
            { maker: "BMW" },
            { maker: "BMW2" }
        ]
    },
    drive: function(){ return "drive"; }
};
here, car is object, engine is an object inside car object and pistons is an array of objects inside engine object.
car.engine or car["engine"];
car.engine.size;
car.drive();
car.engine.pistons[0];
car.engine.pistons[0].maker or car["engine"]["pistons"][1]["maker"];

- an example
var array = [ 
    "string",
    100,
    [ "embed", 200 ],
    { car: "ford" },
    function(){ return "drive"; }
];
here, writing array[4]; will print/return 'function(){ return "drive"' as it as. 
so in order to execute this function, write array[4]();
