OBJECTS AND ARRAYS
- arrays are list of objects and are iterable.
- objects have attributes and subroutines (methods). They are defined by braces {}
- an example of object
var car = {
color: "red",
speed: 200,
drive: function(){return drive;}
};
this is an object car that has attributes like colour, speed and an another function that returns "drive"
- an example of array
var list = ["Dog", "cat", ... ]

EMBEDDING OBJECTS AND ARRAY
- an example array embeded iin object
var car = {
make: "volvo",
speed: 200,
engine: {
size: 2.0,
make: "bmw",
fuel: "petrol",
pistons:["piston1", "piston2"]
}
};
here, we are embedding object inside of an object and we are also embedding the array in the object.
- an example of object embedded in array
var array = [
"name", 
[10,20,30], 
{car: "Ford"}, 
function(){return "Drive"}
];
