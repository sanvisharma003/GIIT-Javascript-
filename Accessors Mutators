- Accessors and mutators helps in accessing the data. underscore(_) is used to tell JS engine that some property is private and accessors should be used ito access them. 
var creditCard = {
  _name: "Sanvi", 
  get name()
  {
    return this._name;
  },
  set name(value)
  {
    this._name = value;
  }
};
console.log(creditCard.name);   //this would use the accessor property and it will be returned through tthe get property.
creditCard.name = "Bob"   //the name is accessed through set property.
- the get and set are accessor properties and not methods. and the _variable can only be accessed using these.
