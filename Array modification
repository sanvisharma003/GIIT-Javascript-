- Arrays are objects!
- To add a new element in the array, find the index and then use assignment operator to assign the new value.
var array = [ "string", 100 ];
array[2] = "Hello"
so the array would look like [ "string", 100, "Hello"]
- If we assign a number like array[20], it will create 16 null elements in between, that take space.
- An another way of creating is 
array["test1"] = "Test1"
array.test2 = "Test2"
but as a result the array no longer behaves as a list.

- array.length; returns length of array
- array.shift(); Delete's first element and shifts it
- array.pop(); Delete's last element and pops the end
- array.unshift( "new", "values" ); Add new values to the beginning of the array
- array.push( "ending", "values" ); Add new values to the end of the array seperated by commas.
- Splice can do anything. splice( point, delete, add values... )
- array.splice( 2(start), 2(no of elements)) would delete 2 elements from positions array[2].
- array.splice( 1(start), 0(no elements to delete), (add any number of elements here) "new elemets", [], {}, 200, 300, function(){} );
